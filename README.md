Client Based Project: MoMoney
=============================

Synopsis:
---------
As part of the major project for term 3, we had to look for a potential client with a problem that we can help them solve. 

My client's problem was that none of the personal finance app suited her needs, so I have taken on the task to help her create a new money tracking app using JavaScript, Node.js and React.js


Design Process:

Installation:

Future Plans:
-------------
Some of the future plans, we have discussed:

  1. Be able to connect the application directly to the user's bank account, so that every transaction doesn't need to be manually inputted. 

  2. Contain a superannuation data section

  3. Application will be accessable on all mobile and tablet devices through App Store or Google Play Store.
